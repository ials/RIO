title: "🗓️ Week 03 - Coordinate systems  and map projections"
---

In this week, we will cover the following topics:

**Theoretical topics**:

- the role of geodesy as a basis for earth datums
- how to calculate distances on a spherical earth
- the basic types of map projection
- the properties of common map projections
- the terminology of common coordinate systems
- how to use  a GIS to convert between coordinate systems 

**Practical exercises**:

Review coordinate systems's metadata 

Reproject vector and raster data
